// Keeping Up With JavaScripts- Part1: ES6 @HomeWork Assignment#3: If Statements and Operators

//Exercise-1: Logical Argument (a Syllogism) 
/* 
  Using "if statements" and any other logical operators and data-types you see fit, recreate this logical argument.
  Your code should make clear that "socrates" is part of a collection of items referred to as "men", and that all 
  members of this collection are mortal. You should also then demonstrate that since Socrates is part of this collection,
  it follows that he is mortal as well.
  
  All men are mortal 
  Socrates is a man.
  Therefore, socrates is mortal
*/

const men = ["plato", "xenophan", "shashi", "socrates"]; // "socrates" is part of collection of members referred to as "men".
const areMembersMortal = true; // All members of this collection are mortal. 
const man = "socrates"; // Socrates is a man and mortal too.

if(areMembersMortal) { // similar to (areMembersMortal === true)
  console.log("All men are mortal."); // Outputs "All men are mortal" as the expression "areMembersMortal is true".
} else{
  console.log("All men are not mortal.");
} 


if ((men.indexOf(man) && areMembersMortal) || man === "shashi") { // Used logical AND/OR operators to evaluate both expressions. 
  console.log("socrates is a man."); // Since socrates is part of collection of men, obviously, he is a man. 
  console.log("Therefore, socrates is mortal."); // Since all men are mortal, socrates is mortal too.
}  else {
  console.log("socrates is not a man nor a mortal");
}


//Extra Credit:
//Exercise-2: Logical Argument (a Syllogism) 
/* 
 This cake is either vanilla or chocolate.
 This cake is not chocolate.
 Therefore, this cake is vanilla.
*/
const cakes = ["vanilla", "chocolate"]; // A cakes Array with two flavours, vanilla and chocolate. 
const cake = "vanilla"; // Assume, the cake is Vanilla. 

if((cake === cakes[0]) || (cake === cakes[1])) { // This cake is either vanilla or chocolate. 
   if(cake !== cakes[1]) { // This cake is not chocolate.
     console.log("Therefore, this cake is " + cake); // Therefore, this cake is vanilla. 
   }
